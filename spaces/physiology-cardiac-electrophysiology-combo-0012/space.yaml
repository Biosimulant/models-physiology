scientific_context:
  question: How do cardiac electrophysiology mechanisms compare across these models?
  mode: comparative
  assumptions:
  - Model implementations are used as published in their curated manifests without
    biological reinterpretation.
  - Time integration uses a shared global tick compatible with model min_dt constraints.
  - Comparative (non-causal) mode is used because full deterministic IO coverage for
    causal coupling was not satisfied.
  expected_observables:
  - Model output trajectories under shared runtime settings.
  - Cross-model agreement/divergence in key state or metric signals.
  - Relative behavior comparison without causal linkage claims.
  limitations:
  - No new biology is introduced beyond what upstream models encode.
  - Cross-model semantic matching is rule-based and may under-connect uncertain routes.
  provenance:
  - 'physiology-cellml-toward-a-comprehensive-cardiomyocyte-model-d59-model :: physiome:d59
    :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/d59'
  - 'physiology-cellml-varela-canine-atrial-cell-models-47c-model :: physiome:47c
    :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/47c'
  visualization_rationale: A dedicated monitor model receives all participating model
    state streams (`state_a..state_d`) so trajectories can be compared in one place
    without claiming causal coupling when IO semantics are incomplete.
