title: 'Physiology: Cardiac Electrophysiology (COMBO_0005)'
description: "Physiology Cardiac Electrophysiology (COMBO_0005) organizes fcu_cardiac_1, fcu_cardiacap_2, state_compare_mon into a comparative simulation setup to examine how cardiac electrophysiology mechanisms compare across these m. When you run it, you can compare participant trajectories through shared runtime settings and routed output streams."

scientific_context:
  question: How do cardiac electrophysiology mechanisms compare across these models?
  mode: comparative
  assumptions:
  - Model implementations are used as published in their curated manifests without
    biological reinterpretation.
  - Time integration uses a shared global tick compatible with model min_dt constraints.
  - Comparative (non-causal) mode is used because full deterministic IO coverage for
    causal coupling was not satisfied.
  expected_observables:
  - Model output trajectories under shared runtime settings.
  - Cross-model agreement/divergence in key state or metric signals.
  - Relative behavior comparison without causal linkage claims.
  limitations:
  - No new biology is introduced beyond what upstream models encode.
  - Cross-model semantic matching is rule-based and may under-connect uncertain routes.
  provenance:
  - 'physiology-cellml-fcu-cardiac-ph-885-model :: physiome:885 :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/885'
  - 'physiology-cellml-fcu-cardiacap-composite-839-model :: physiome:839 :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/839'
  visualization_rationale: A dedicated monitor model receives all participating model
    state streams (`state_a..state_d`) so trajectories can be compared in one place
    without claiming causal coupling when IO semantics are incomplete.
