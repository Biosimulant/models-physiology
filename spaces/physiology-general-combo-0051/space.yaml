title: 'Physiology: General (COMBO_0051)'
description: "Physiology General (COMBO_0051) assembles bg_k_1, bg_k_2, bg_k1_3 as a comparative composed simulation to examine how general mechanisms compare across these models. When you run it, you can compare synchronized outputs through the declared wiring paths and monitor views."

scientific_context:
  question: How do general mechanisms compare across these models?
  mode: comparative
  assumptions:
  - Model implementations are used as published in their curated manifests without
    biological reinterpretation.
  - Time integration uses a shared global tick compatible with model min_dt constraints.
  - Comparative (non-causal) mode is used because full deterministic IO coverage for
    causal coupling was not satisfied.
  expected_observables:
  - Model output trajectories under shared runtime settings.
  - Cross-model agreement/divergence in key state or metric signals.
  - Relative behavior comparison without causal linkage claims.
  limitations:
  - No new biology is introduced beyond what upstream models encode.
  - Cross-model semantic matching is rule-based and may under-connect uncertain routes.
  provenance:
  - 'physiology-cellml-bg-k-823-model :: physiome:823 :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/823'
  - 'physiology-cellml-bg-k-atp-83a-model :: physiome:83a :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/83a'
  - 'physiology-cellml-bg-k1-824-model :: physiome:824 :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/824'
  visualization_rationale: A dedicated monitor model receives all participating model
    state streams (`state_a..state_d`) so trajectories can be compared in one place
    without claiming causal coupling when IO semantics are incomplete.
