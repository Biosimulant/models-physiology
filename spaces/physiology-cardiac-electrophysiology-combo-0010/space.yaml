title: 'Physiology: Cardiac Electrophysiology (COMBO_0010)'
description: "Physiology Cardiac Electrophysiology (COMBO_0010) brings together koivum_ki_1, michaelpancardia_2, state_compare_mon in a comparative space to examine how cardiac electrophysiology mechanisms compare across these models. When you run it, you can compare participant trajectories through shared runtime settings and routed output streams."

scientific_context:
  question: How do cardiac electrophysiology mechanisms compare across these models?
  mode: comparative
  assumptions:
  - Model implementations are used as published in their curated manifests without
    biological reinterpretation.
  - Time integration uses a shared global tick compatible with model min_dt constraints.
  - Comparative (non-causal) mode is used because full deterministic IO coverage for
    causal coupling was not satisfied.
  expected_observables:
  - Model output trajectories under shared runtime settings.
  - Cross-model agreement/divergence in key state or metric signals.
  - Relative behavior comparison without causal linkage claims.
  limitations:
  - No new biology is introduced beyond what upstream models encode.
  - Cross-model semantic matching is rule-based and may under-connect uncertain routes.
  provenance:
  - 'physiology-cellml-koivum-ki-korhonen-tavi-2011-atrial-ap-model-630-model :: physiome:630
    :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/630'
  - 'physiology-cellml-michaelpancardiacapmodel-b16-model :: physiome:b16 :: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/b16'
  visualization_rationale: A dedicated monitor model receives all participating model
    state streams (`state_a..state_d`) so trajectories can be compared in one place
    without claiming causal coupling when IO semantics are incomplete.
