# Space Prompt - physiology-general-combo-0013

Create a scientifically coherent **physiology / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: physiology-cellml-a-mathematical-model-of-the-neural-regulation-of-b01-model, physiology-cellml-a-mathematical-model-of-the-outer-medullary-coll-5b7-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
