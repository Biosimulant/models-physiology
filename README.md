# models-physiology

Curated collection of **physiology** simulation models for the **biosim** platform. This repository contains 923 comprehensive computational models of organ systems, whole-body physiology, homeostatic regulation, and integrative physiological processes.

## What's Inside

### Models (923 packages)

**Physiology** — organ systems, homeostatic regulation, and integrative physiology:

**Key Areas:** Cardiovascular physiology, respiratory dynamics, renal function, endocrine regulation, gastrointestinal processes, musculoskeletal mechanics, thermoregulation, acid-base balance, fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, and multi-organ integration.

This is the **second-largest** repository (after metabolism), containing comprehensive systems-level physiological models. All models use SBML format with tellurium runtime.

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install "biosim @ git+https://github.com/BioSimulant/biosim.git@main"
```
